# QALYPSO 2024 VQA LECTURES

In this tutorial, I will give a tutorial on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), 
that leverage both quantum and classical resources to solve optimization problems

In particular, I will walk you through the Variational Quantum Eigensolver, 
which will enable you to determine the ground-state of the hydrogen molecule!

## Installing these notebooks

1. Go to the directory you want to download the repository on using the terminal.
2. You can run `git clone https://github.com/mirkoconsiglio/VQA_tutorial.git` in your specified directory.
3. Then `cd` to the directory.
4. Create virtual environment using either `virtualenv VQA_tutorial` or `conda create VQA_tutorial` if you have Conda installed.
5. If you installed with `virtualenv` then run `source VQA_tutorial/bin/activate` or `conda activate VQA_tutorial` if you used Conda.
6. Then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
7. Run `jupyter-notebook` in your terminal.
