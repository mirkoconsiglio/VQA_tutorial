# QALYPSO 2024 VQA LECTURES

In this tutorial, I will give a tutorial on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), 
that leverage both quantum and classical resources to solve optimization problems

In particular, I will walk you through the Variational Quantum Eigensolver, 
which will enable you to determine the ground-state of the hydrogen molecule!
