    "# An Introduction to Variational Quantum Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computing is a relatively young field, which bloomed as an idea to Benioff when he proposed the quantum mechanical analogue of a Turing machine, which was quickly followed up by Deutsch, and Feynman, among many others. Research in quantum computing flourished when Shor devised a quantum algorithm that efficiently determines prime factors of composite integers, which could result in the collapse of many modern cryptographic protocols. Since then, many quantum algorithms have been designed with varying applications, ranging from optimisation, machine learning, quantum many-body physics and chemistry, cryptography, communication and pharmaceuticals.\n",

    "## Computational Complexity Theory in a Nutshell\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational complexity theory is a means of assigning computational problems to\n",
    "different complexity classes, each with its own set of characteristics and limitations in\n",
    "terms of some resource, most commonly time and memory. For the sake of conciseness, we\n",
    "shall briefly describe the asymptotic notation of function complexity, and only mention the\n",
    "relevant complexity classes to this course. The most important three definitions for asymptotic complexity\n",
    "(as a function the size of the system $n$) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $f(n) = \\mathcal{O}(T(n))$, where $f$ is said to be asymptotically bounded above by $T$ (up to a multiplicative constant).\n",
    "- $f(n) = \\Omega(T(n))$, where $f$ is said to be asymptotically bounded below by $T$ (up to a multiplicative constant).\n",
    "- $f(n) = \\Theta(T(n))$, where $f$ is said to be asymptotically bounded above and below by $T$ (up to two multiplicative constants).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we turn our attention to complexity classes which are relevant to the algorithms and concepts discussed in this work.\n",
    "- $P$: problems that can be solved in a polynomial time by a deterministic classical computer. This means that the problem can be solved in $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^k\\right)~\\exists~k > 1$.\n",
    "- $NP$: problems that can be verified in a polynomial time by a deterministic classical computer, but not necessarily solved in such a time. This implies that the problem can be verified in $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^k\\right)~\\exists~k > 1$, however the solution cannot be determined faster than $\\Omega\\left(n^k\\right)~\\forall~k > 1$.\n",
    "- $BQP$: stands for Bounded-error Probabilistic Polynomial-time. Essentially equivalent to $P$ but for a quantum computer.\n",
    "- $PSPACE$: stands for Polynomial Space. Problems that can be solved in a polynomial space by a deterministic classical computer.\n",
    "- $EXPTIME$: stands for Exponential Time. Problems that can be solved in an exponential time by a deterministic classical computer. This means that the problem can be solved in $\\mathcal{O}\\left(k^n\\right)~\\exists~k > 1$.\n",
    "- $QMA$: stands for Quantum Merlin--Arthur and is the quantum analogy for $NP$. A problem is said to be in $QMA$ if the solution can be verified in a polynomial time by a quantum computer, if it is given \"yes\" as an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classes mentioned above can be neatly placed in containers as shown in the figure below. Furthermore, the last few important definitions are the concepts of reducibility, hardness and completeness. A problem $A$ is said to be reducible to a problem $B$, if a method for solving $B$ implies a method for solving $A$. This is denoted as $A \\leq B$. This can also be interpreted that solving $B$ is at least as hard as solving $A$. Given a complexity class $C$, a problem $X$ is said to be $C$-hard if every problem in $C$ reduces to $X$, and finally, a problem $X$ is said to be $C$-complete if $X$ is $C$-hard and also $X \\in C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img height=\"500\" src=\"figures/complexity_classes.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical example of a $BQP$ problem is integer factorisation, which is polynomially solvable by a quantum computer using Shor's algorithm. On the other hand, there is no known classical algorithm that can factor integers in polynomial time. However, it is crucial to carry out tests for quantum algorithmic complexity, as it is obscure whether quantum computers are able to solve $NP$-Complete problems in polynomial time. In fact, most of the algorithms which will be discussed in this work are related to the preparation of a desired initial state. It is established that preparing --- and also *finding* specific states, such as ground-states of Hamiltonians --- is $QMA$-hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Era of Noise. Is there a Solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "While the fault-tolerant quantum computer era might herald in a new age of unparalleled efficiency through quantum algorithms, we are still a far cry away from achieving quantum advantage. Initially, most of the proposed quantum algorithms required millions of physical qubits to operate successfully and efficiently, along with the implementation of quantum error correction (QEC) protocols, to reduce the inherent decoherence of qubits, improper gate control and measurement errors --- collectively known as noise. Currently, we are in the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, where we only have access to around 100 noisy qubits at most. As a result, most of the current quantum algorithms had to be devised with the current severe limitations in mind. In fact, the main goal in the NISQ era is to develop techniques and algorithms which are able to extract the maximum available quantum computational power, while also being suitable to scale for the future long-term goal of fault-tolerant quantum computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are the means of harnessing the power given by NISQ computers? Since the capacity of a modern quantum computer is limited, many algorithms are devised in a hybrid quantum--classical manner. Such algorithms assign a classically demanding component to a quantum computer, while the tractable part is still carried out on a (sufficiently powerful) classical computer. The concept of these algorithms typically involves some variational updates to parameters in a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), subsequently termed variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) (also known as hybrid quantum--classical algorithms). Originally, the first two designs for VQAs were the: variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), initially proposed to solve quantum chemistry problems; and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), intended to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Both of these algorithms can be considered as the parents of the entire VQA family.\n",

    "A VQA is made up of separate modules that can be easily combined, improved and extended according to the developments in quantum technology. The different modules of a VQA are the:\n",

    "1. Objective Function\n",
    "2. Parameterized Quantum Circuit\n",
    "3. Measurement Technique\n",
    "4. Classical Optimiser\n",

    "\n",
    "## Objective Function\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering a quantum system, the Hamiltonian contains all the relevant information of that system. In quantum chemistry or many-body physics, the expectation value of the Hamiltonian can lead to the energy of the system, which is often used as the objective function to be minimised. On the other hand, for combinatorial problems, and others which do not fall in the realm of real physical systems, the respective problem can be encoded into a Hamiltonian (or observable), allowing them to be solved on a quantum computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function is then simply defined as\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the Hamiltonian of the problem is determined --- along with the associated objective function --- the next step is to decompose it into a set of operators which are measurable on the quantum device. The most common of which is Pauli string decomposition, where such a decomposed Hamiltonian is given as\n",

A Pauli string can be written as tensored Pauli operators $\\sigma^x, \\sigma^y, \\sigma^z$ --- $P = \\bigotimes_{j = 1}^{n} \\sigma$, where $\\sigma \\in \\{I, \\sigma^x, \\sigma^y, \\sigma^z\\}$, with $I$ being the identity operator. As a result, the expectation value of the Hamiltonian can then be measured by evaluating the expectation value of each of the decomposed Pauli strings:\n",

    "Other objective functions can also be used, not just Hamiltonian expectation values. In fact, any cost function that can be written in an operational form can be evaluated using a quantum computer, and thus used as an objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parametrised Quantum Circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the objective function is determined, the next component of the VQA is the quantum circuit that is capable of preparing the quantum state that matches the minimum of the objective function. The quantum state is prepared via a unitary operation that depends on some parameters, that is a PQC.\n",

The purpose of preparing a good initial state is so that the algorithm is able to optimise the parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ close to an optimal point, helping the overall convergence of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following initial state preparation, the choice of the unitary ansatz $U(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ considerably affects the performance of the VQA. A necessary condition to find the optimum is that the quantum state that minimises the objective function is within the Hilbert space of the PQC. However, more complex unitaries generally lead to deeper and non-local circuits, which are more susceptible to errors. As a result, unitary ansatz selection currently falls into two categories, problem-inspired or hardware-efficient, depending on their structure.\n",

These layers are then repeated enough times to generate a sufficient amount of entanglement and enable the exploration of a large portion of the Hilbert space.\n",

    "## Measurement Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "A quantum computer can only supply information via measuring quantum states. Typically, the expectation value of a Hamiltonian or operator is required to minimise an objective function. This requires a unitary transformation on the quantum state to the diagonal basis of the Hamiltonian. However, in principle, this is hard to achieve on a NISQ device. The purpose of transforming a Hamiltonian into Pauli strings is because their expectation value can be easily determined on a quantum computer. Typically, the computational basis states $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$ can be measured to give the expectation value of the $\\sigma^z$ operator,\n",

    "where $S = \\sqrt{\\sigma^z}$ and $H = (\\sigma^x + \\sigma^z)/\\sqrt{2}$ is the Hadamard gate. The expectation values can be determined by applying the transforming gates on the states before measuring in the computational basis, so that\n",

    "In many cases, the number of Pauli strings can be so significantly large that it is costly to evaluate each one of them individually. Recently, various approaches that can efficiently measure the expectation value of a Hamiltonian have been proposed, such as grouping different Pauli strings together in such a way that they can be measured simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other techniques exist, such as measuring the overlap of a quantum state with a unitary operator, using for example the Hadamard test, or direct implementation techniques. Another method is shadow tomography, which involves measuring the classical shadow of a quantum state to extract the expectation value of observables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classical Optimiser\n",
    "\n",
    "Up till now, we have only described the parts of a VQA that run on a quantum device. The final piece is the classical optimisation loop, that produces variational parameter updates to the PQC, tying everything in to create a hybrid quantum--classical algorithm. The specific choice of an optimiser greatly impacts the performance of the VQA. In principle, one can apply any method available in the entire field of multivariate optimisation. However, once again the NISQ era holds us back, since short coherence times prevent the use of analytical gradient circuits, as they are not efficiently implementable, while numerous function evaluations correspond to a significantly long time to calculate the objective function. At the same time, the results from a quantum computer are noisy, both from statistical and quantum device errors, requiring an optimiser that is noise-resistant. As a result, most of the typically used optimisers are not adequate for VQA, and as a result, new optimisation algorithms and techniques are being developed to optimise PQC.\n",

    "\n",
    "One may prefer to employ an optimiser that does not rely on gradient information measured on a quantum computer. There are methods based on evolutionary algorithms, which have been recently applied to VQA, that show comparable performance to gradient-based approaches. Reinforcement learning is another method, originally used to optimise the parameters of QAOA. Surrogate model-based optimisation is an alternative technique to optimise an objective function. It is specifically used when function evaluations are costly to calculate, and so use previous evaluations to inform future iterations of the optimiser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, sequential minimal optimisation is a technique which will discuss last. Given that all the parameters in a variational circuit are angles, the expectation value of an operator $U$ is sinusoidal in nature, when all but one of the parameters are fixed. As a result, the expectation value can be written as\n",

Selecting $\\phi = 0$ and choosing $k$ such that $\\theta^* \\in (-\\pi, \\pi$ is usually the most straightforward choice. The algorithm then proceeds by looping over all the variational parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ until convergence is reached."
